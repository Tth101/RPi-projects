# Overview
This repo is used to store my raspberry pi projects as well as document the process

As each project are mostly reliant on my own research and understanding, take any information with a grain of salt and expect errors/misinformation.\
In addition, any solutions or methods might be inefficient, so do tweak accordingly.

Most, if not all projects are set up on docker + portainer to allow for easy management

# Pre requisite
* Installation and set up of docker & portainer \
